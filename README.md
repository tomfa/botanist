# botanist

botanist is a chat bot built on the [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) framework,
that demonstrates common features of hubot, using JavaScript. Its purpose is to
kickstart developers who wish to start using Hubot, but wish to use JavaScript
instead of Coffeescript.

It's generated to integrate with [Slack](https://www.slack.com/), but can easily
be updated to support one of [Hubots many adapters](https://hubot.github.com/docs/adapters/).

For those that want to use Coffeescript, [Hubots own documentation](https://hubot.github.com/docs/) should suffice.
